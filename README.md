  ## Installation

  You can install the project by downloading the files and installing the dependencies. You then need to configure your database, either locally or with MongoDB Atlas. 
  
  ## Usage

  You use the app by creating an account or signing in. You then search for books and can add them to your personal list of saved books. There is a link to view your saved books. There you can delete any unwanted books from your list.
