## Installation

You can install the project by downloading the files and installing the dependencies. You then need to configure your database, either locally or with MongoDB Atlas.

## Usage

You use the app by creating an account or signing in. You then search for books and can add them to your personal list of saved books. There is a link to view your saved books. There you can delete any unwanted books from your list.
